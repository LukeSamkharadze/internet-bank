# Notification Component

## Usage

In order to use notification component it is necessary to use this code â–¼

```html
<app-shared-notification
  *ngIf="appearance"
  (closePopup)="closePopup()"
  [color]=""
  >Notification message
</app-shared-notification>
```

- When `appearance` - **true**, notification is visible and when **false**, it disappears.

- `(closePopup)` is an event that is emitted when `(x)` button is pressed on popup.  
  `"closePopup()"` function should be a function that makes appearance variable **false**.

- `[color]` input is for concrete style. You need to indicate `color` that can be one of the colors listed below.
  By default, when using `[color]` like this - `[color]=""`, notification text color is grey with white background.
