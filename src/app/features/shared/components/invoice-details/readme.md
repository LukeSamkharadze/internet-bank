## **Usage**

_Us this component in your feature like this_

```HTML
<app-shared-invoice-details
	*ngIf="popDetails"
	(close)="closePopup()"
	[invoice]="invoiceObject">
</app-shared-invoice-details>
```

where **popDetails** is a variable that is either true or false. If you want this modal to pop up then you should make popDetails **true**.
