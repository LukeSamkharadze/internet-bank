## **Usage**

_Us this component in your feature like this_

```HTML
<app-shared-invoice-details
	*ngIf="popDetails"
	(closePopup)="closePopup()"
	[invoice]="invoiceObject">
</app-shared-invoice-details>
```

where **popDetails** is a variable that is either true or false. If you want this modal to pop up then you should make popDetails **true**.

**invoice** is an input that should look like this

```TS
  id: number;
  template: string;
  invoiceNumber: string;
  dueDate: string;
  companyName: string;
  contactEmail: string;
  address: string; //Better if addresses are divided by commas(","), to add them on new line
  items: ItemsModel[];
  totalAmount: number;
  status: string; //Only 'Paid', 'Pending' or 'Cancelled'
  invoiceCreateDate: string;
```

every parameter is **_required_**. **ItemsModel** is also an interface that looks like this

```TS
  itemDescription: string,
  price: number,
  itemQty: number,
```
