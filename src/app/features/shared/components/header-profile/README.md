By clicking the user div a menu appears which has settings, user's profile and sign out options.

This feature uses inputs of user's name, mail and image:
name: string; <- user's name and surname for example 'Barry Armstrong'
mail: string; <- user's mail for example 'b.armstrong@gmail.com'
image: string; <- user's profile image source for example './../../../../assets/header-profile/User.png'
